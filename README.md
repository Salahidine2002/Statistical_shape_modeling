# Statistical Shape Modeling

First step : Installing the requirements 

 Type the following command line to install all the necessary packages to run the code :
            
    pip install -r requirements.txt 

Second step : Running the demonstration 

 Go to the file Statistical analysis/Faces_reconstruction/Gaussian_processes_faces, run the jupyter code and remember to close the visualization popping windows so that the code executes the other cells. 

 The demonstration shows the shapes reconstruction on the faces dataset after the alignment, data augmentation and processes prallelization.
